    <h2>Easy Appetizer Meatballs</h2>
    <p>What better way to start off your meal than with a few balls of meat?!  These are the perfect starter for any occasion, but especially those crisp fall evenings!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground pork sausage</li>
            <li>1 pound ground spicy pork sausage</li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) can frozen orange juice concentrate, thawed</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine pork sausage and spicy pork sausage together in a bowl using your hands.  Form mixture into meatballs, about 1 tablespoon each.</li>
            <li>Fry meatballs in a skillet over medium heat until browned and completely cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Transfer meatballs to a large bowl and add 1/2 of the orange juice concentrate; gently toss to coat, adding more if needed to completely coat.</li>
            <li>Put meatballs in a slow cooker and add the remaining juice concentrate; turn on Low setting to keep warm before serving.</li>
